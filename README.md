# Relative splits
An Openplanet plugin that displays the delta (difference) between 2 checkpoints compared to your PB run.
For example, if you have `-0.500` on Checkpoint 1, and `-0.400` on Checkpoint 2, you lost `0.100`. That `0.100` would be the number displayed by this plugin.

> Currently not released, still in beta. Feel free to try it out & to submit PRs.
